1. Once the codespace is created, you will see a new window with a terminal on the bottom and a file explorer on the left.

1. Click on the green button that says `Code` and select `codespaces` from the dropdown menu. It should have a link to access the codespace (The codespace might have been randomly assigned some name).

OR
1. go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) and you can see all your available codespaces.

    2. If you are using your own computer, you need to install `git lfs` to properly download all the files. download the     git lfs` from [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
